This Next.js starter template can be used for your blog or personal sites. It's built with the following technologies:

Next.js App Router
Content processing with Contentlayer
Writing posts with MDX
Styling with Tailwind CSS

This starter template is heavily inspired by Lee Robinson's blog

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChangoMan/nextjs-mdx-blog.git
cd nextjs-typescript-mdx-blog

npm install

npm run dev
```

Blog posts can be added to the `posts` directory, in the root folder.

Update the `WEBSITE_HOST_URL` when taking your site live. `/src/lib/constants.ts`

Update `sitemap.ts` file, specifically the `const routes` if you add more pages to the website.
